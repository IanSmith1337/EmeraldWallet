# About Emerald

## What is Emerald?

A centralized wallet in a decentralized world. Highly modular and customizable; Just connect it to any supported API you need and weâ€™ll do the rest. No need to hop from site to site trying to port funds from one ETH chain to another! No more fighting Binance and others trying to convert your Dogecoin life savings to ETH. And trying to see your NFTs and all the offers on your Bored Ape without leaving your wallet? We got you covered there too.

# Install Guide

All you have to do is download the file that matches your system.

Darwin is the MacOS release.

rpm, nupkg and deb are Linux versions.

The one ending in .exe is Windows.

You can install from source, however, you'd need Node.JS. More details on that later on in development.
